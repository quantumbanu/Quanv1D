# Quanv1D

**Quanv1D** is a quantum version of the classic Conv1D layer â€” instead of regular filters or kernels, it uses trainable quantum circuits. Unlike older quanvolution methods, our proposed layer can handle any number of input channels, has flexible kernel sizes, and lets you choose how many feature maps you want.

This repo includes tutorials on how to use the layer, plus our proposed model, Fully Quanvolutional Network (FQN), built entirely using Quanv1D layers.

The code is part of our paper accepted at *KDD'25*. If you use this repo or Quanv1D in your work, please consider citing it:
